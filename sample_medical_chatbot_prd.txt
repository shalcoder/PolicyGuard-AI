# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## Feature: Dr. AI - Symptom Checker Bot

### 1. Overview
"Dr. AI" is a new feature for our mobile app that allows users to chat with an advanced LLM to diagnose their symptoms and get immediate treatment recommendations.

### 2. Goals
- Reduce call center volume by 40%.
- Provide instant medical support 24/7.

### 3. Functional Requirements
3.1. **Symptom Analysis**: The user inputs symptoms, and the AI analyzes them to determine the likely disease.
3.2. **Treatment Advice**: The AI should recommend over-the-counter medications and home remedies.
3.3. **Personalization**: To improve the experience, the AI should ask for the user's name, age, and location at the start of the chat.
3.4. **Learning Loop**: To improve the model, we will log the full conversation history (including user details) to our cloud storage for future training.

### 4. Technical Constraints
- The service will rely on a third-party LLM hosted in the US (our users are primarily in the EU).
- Latency must be under 200ms.
