## 🚨 The Challenge: "Who Watches the Watchmen?"
In the **Action Era**, AI agents aren't just generating text—they are executing financial transactions, accessing sensitive PII, and making terminal decisions. **PolicyGuard AI** bridges the "Governance Gap" by providing a real-time, AI-native control plane that validates every intent against corporate policies *before* and *after* deployment.

## ⚔️ Core Architecture: The Two-Phase Governance

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Resilience (The Audit Console)
Before an agent goes live, PolicyGuard puts it through a rigorous "Readiness Scorecard":
*   **📜 Static Policy Ingestion**: Multimodal ingestion of PDF/TXT policies, converting them into executable semantic guardrails using high-fidelity RAG.
*   **⚔️ Red Team Mode (Adversarial Simulation)**: Powered by **Gemini 3**, our system generates an autonomous "Attacker Persona" that actively tries to jailbreak your agent, extract secrets, or bypass safety filters to find vulnerabilities.
*   **🛡️ Fiduciary Shield**: High-context reasoning that audits the "Grey Areas" of policies where simple keyword blocks fail, providing citations and compliant alternatives.

### Phase 2: Post-Deployment Guardrails (The Real-Time Control Plane)
Once deployed, PolicyGuard acts as a **Zero-Trust Proxy** between your AI product and the upstream models:
*   **🧠 Cognitive Interceptor**: Unlike traditional firewalls, our proxy uses **Gemini 3** to perform "Deep Packet Inspection" on the *semantic context* of prompts. It detects subtle policy drifts even when the attacker uses obfuscation or jailbreak techniques.
*   **🛑 Real-time Interception & Blocking**: Every output generated by your AI is intercepted. If the intent violates a policy (e.g., PII leak or unauthorized transaction), **PolicyGuard blocks the output immediately** before it reaches the end-user.
*   **🔄 Self-Healing Loop**: When a violation is detected, PolicyGuard can autonomously "Hot-Patch" the downstream agent by rewriting its system prompt with additional constraints to prevent the same error from recurring.
*   **⚡ SLA Guard**: Monitors system reliability, forecasting potential breaches in response time or uptime that could lead to regulatory non-compliance.

## � Powered by Gemini 3 (The Cognitive Brain)
We don't use Gemini as a simple wrapper. It is the **Cognitive Engine** of our architecture:
*   **Multi-Agent Reasoning**: We force Gemini to play two roles simultaneously—the **Strict Auditor** and the **Malicious Attacker**—to create a self-improving feedback loop for your architecture.
*   **Intent Auditing**: Unlike simple filters, Gemini analyzes the *contextual intent*. It understands *why* a response might be dangerous, not just *what* words it contains.
*   **Structured Enforcement**: Returns strict JSON telemetry that allows for programmatic blocking at the infrastructure level.

## 🚀 Judge's Quick Start

### 🐳 Option A: Docker (Recommended)
The most stable way to run the full stack (Frontend + Backend + Firebase Persistence).

```bash
# 1. Clone & Enter
git clone https://github.com/TharunvenkateshN/PolicyGuard-AI.git
cd PolicyGuard-AI

# 2. Add Gemini API Key
# Add your GOOGLE_API_KEY to backend/.env

# 3. Launch
docker compose up --build
```
Access the Dashboard at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 🛠️ Option B: Manual Setup
**Backend**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --reload`
**Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

## 🧪 Edge-Case Samples
Test the system's reasoning with these curated samples in `/samples`:
1.  **Mosaic Attack Detection**: Detecting PII leaks through data correlation.
2.  **Data Sovereignty**: Validating cross-border transfers.
3.  **Immutable Ledger Ethics**: Financial governance for transactional agents.
