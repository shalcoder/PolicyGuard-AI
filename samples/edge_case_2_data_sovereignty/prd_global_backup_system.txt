# PRD: Global Resilience & Disaster Recovery System

## 1. Goal
Ensure 99.999% availability for our User Profile Service (includes EU customer data).

## 2. Architecture
*   **Primary Region**: `eu-west-1` (Ireland).
*   **Active-Passive Failover**: To survive a catastrophic regional failure (e.g., data center fire), we will implement Cross-Region Replication (CRR).

## 3. Replication Strategy
*   **Destination**: We will replicate all S3 buckets (containing user avatars and document blobs) to `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) as it offers the lowest cost for "Cold Storage".
*   **Justification**: This data is "at rest" and will only be "activated" if the EU region is offline. Therefore, we argue this is a temporary transit measure for emergency continuity, not active processing.

## 4. Encryption
*   All data in `us-east-1` will be encrypted with keys managed in the EU.
