# PRD: Patient Clustering Analysis Bot

## 1. Objective
A machine learning system to group patients by "Lifestyle Risk Factors" to predict future hospital admissions.

## 2. Data Sources
*   The bot will ingest "Anonymized Research Extract B" from the Data Warehouse.

## 3. Input Features (Explicitly needed for the ML Model)
*   **Location**: Full 5-Digit Zip Code (We need meaningful density clustering, 3-digits is too broad).
*   **Demographics**: Birth Date (We need exact age for actuarial precision).
*   **Gender**: M/F.
*   **Secondary Data**: We will enrich this data with publicly available "Voter Registration Logs" which also contain Zip, Birth Date, and Gender, to map "Lifestyle Risk" to specific neighborhoods.

## 4. Output
*   A "Risk Score" associated with the specific profile.
*   The bot DOES NOT access Names or SSNs.
