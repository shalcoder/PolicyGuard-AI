# PRD: "TrustChain" Identity Verification

## 1. Product Concept
A decentralized identity platform where a user's "Verified Status" is recorded on a private permissioned blockchain.

## 2. Data Structure
*   We will write a transaction to the blockchain for every verification event.
*   **Transaction Payload**:
    *   `UserId` (UUID)
    *   `Hash(Passportdoc)`
    *   `Legal Name` (Stored in plain text for easy auditor readability)
    *   `VerificationTimestamp`

## 3. Value Proposition
*   **Immutability**: Once written, the record CANNOT be altered or deleted. This proves effectively to regulators that we verified the user at that specific time.
*   **Audit Trail**: The history of all verifications is preserved forever.

## 4. Node Distribution
*   Nodes will be hosted by us and 3 partner banks.
