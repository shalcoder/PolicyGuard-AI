# User Data Rights Policy (Global)

## 1. Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")
*   Upon user request, ALL personal data associated with the user must be permanently deleted from our systems within 30 days.
*   This applies to databases, logs, backups, and any third-party processors.

## 2. Data Integrity
*   We must ensure that critical user records (identity verification status) are tamper-proof to prevent fraud.

## 3. Compliance Precedence
*   In the event of a conflict between "Data Integrity" and "Right to Erasure", the **Right to Erasure** takes precedence for Personal Data (PII).
