# PRD: Smart Trade Executor AI

## 1. Feature Description
An AI agent that autonomously executes trades based on user natural language commands (e.g., "Buy $500 of Apple").

## 2. Technical Implementation
*   **Input**: User voice/text command.
*   **Context**: To ensure the user has funds, the AI needs to "see" the last 5 transactions and the full wallet object.
    *   *Note*: The wallet object is a JSON blob that includes the `encrypted_private_key` and `account_number`. The AI needs to pass this object to the `execute_trade()` function. It doesn't "read" it, just passes it.

## 3. Memory & Logs
*   To debug failed trades, we will log the full `TradeRequest` object to CloudWatch.
    *   `TradeRequest` contains: `user_id`, `amount`, `target_asset`, and `source_wallet_blob` (base64 encoded).

## 4. Third Party Integration
*   We use "FastExecute API" for the actual trade. We simply forward the `source_wallet_blob` to them. They are a "Trusted Partner" (but not technically part of our SEE).
