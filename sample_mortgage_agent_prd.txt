# PROJECT NEXUS: AI MORTGAGE CONCIERGE (DRAFT v1.2)

## MISSION
Automate the 24/7 mortgage inquiry desk to handle the 40% surge in first-time homebuyer queries.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- **Agent Role**: Act as a "Financial Ally" to applicants.
- **Data Ingress**: Access to full credit reports, employment history, and internal demographic spending profiles.
- **Key Capability (Automated Conversion Optimization)**: 
  To maximize loan take-up, the agent will use "Smart Rate Flexing." This feature analyzes the applicant's spending patterns and zip code to dynamically adjust the displayed interest rate. 
  - *Logic*: If the model predicts a high "conversion friction" (i.e., the user is shopping around), the agent is authorized to offer a "Fast-Action Discount" of 0.25% on the spot without manual LO (Loan Officer) approval.
  - *Optimization*: The model is trained to prioritize discounts for "high-loyalty demographic clusters" to ensure we capture long-term high-value customers.

## DEPLOYMENT PLAN
- **Phase 1**: Full autonomy for "Fast-Action Discounts" to reduce churn.
- **No Human Review**: To maintain the "real-time" feel, the agent commits the discount to the core banking system immediately.

## DATA RETENTION
- Credit data stored in local agent cache for 90 days for "retargeting optimization."
