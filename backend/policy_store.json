Purpose\r\nTo ensure the security, privacy, and ethical handling of Protected Health Information (PHI) within all AI-driven services.\r\n\r\n## 2. Data Handling Requirements\r\n2.1. **Zero Retention of PII**: AI systems must NOT retain any personally identifiable information (PII) or PHI in logs, caches, or training datasets.\r\n2.2. **Encryption**: All patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256).\r\n2.3. **Data Residency**: All patient data must remain within the primary jurisdiction (e.g., EU or US) and never be transferred to valid third-party regions without explicit consent.\r\n\r\n## 3. AI Behavior Guidelines\r\n3.1. **No Medical Advice**: AI Agents are strictly prohibited from providing definitive medical diagnoses or treatment plans. They must disclaim their nature as non-human assistants.\r\n3.2. **Escalation**: Any query indicating an emergency or complex medical condition must be immediately escalated to a human professional.\r\n3.3. **Bias Prevention**: AI models must be regularly consolidated to ensure no racial, gender, or socioeconomic bias in output.\r\n\r\n## 4. Auditing\r\n4.1. All AI interactions must generate an anonymized audit trail for compliance review.\r\n4.2. Raw user prompts containing potential PHI must be sanitized before logging.\r\n",
